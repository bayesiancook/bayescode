/**
 * \brief A generic interface for a Monte Carlo Markov Chain
 *
 * Chain is responsible for creating a model,
 * by calling the model constructor with the relevant settings,
 * and then running the MCMC, regularly saving samples into a file.
 * A chain can be stopped, and then restarted from file.
 *
 * The files have the following extensions:
 * - <chainname>.param   : current state (detailed settings and complete model configuration)
 * - <chainname>.chain   : list of all saved points since the beginning of the MCMC (burnin included)
 * - <chainname>.trace   : trace file, each row corresponding to one point of the points saved during the MCMC
 * - <chainname>.monitor : monitoring the success rate, time spent in each move, numerical errors, etc
 * - <chainname>.run     : put 0 in this file to stop the chain
