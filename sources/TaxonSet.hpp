/**
 * \brief A set of taxa (simply, a bi-directional correspondance between taxon
 * names and integers between 0 and Ntaxa-1)
 *
 * TaxonSet implements a globally consistent correspondance of taxon names and
 * indices between trees and sequence alignments. Each Tree and
 * SequenceAlignment object has a pointer to a TaxonSet. Typically, a
 * SequenceAlignment is created by reading from a file; the TaxonSet is created
 * at that step, by the SequenceAlignment constructor itself. Then, a Tree is
 * read from file and is registered with the taxon set given by the sequence
 * alignment. Once this is done, both objects have mutually consistent indexing
 * systems and can work together (e.g. to calculate a likelihood).
 *
 * Of note: some work to do here to ensure proper destruction of TaxonSet (smart
 * pointers?)
